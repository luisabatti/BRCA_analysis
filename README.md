# Analyzing and Clustering Breast Cancer Patients using R 
[luisabatti.github.io/BRCA_analysis/](https://luisabatti.github.io/BRCA_analysis/)

# Summary

1️⃣ This project leverages the power of the TCGAbiolinks and DESeq2 packages to perform a comprehensive analysis of breast cancer transcriptome datasets sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The goal is to gain insights into the molecular landscape of breast cancer and identify misregulated genes in this disease.

2️⃣ This pipeline encompasses data querying, data cleaning, differential expression analysis, visualization of differentially expressed genes between tumor and normal tissue samples, exploratory data analysis among breast cancer patients, and the application of principal component analysis (PCA) for patient clustering.

3️⃣ This project utilizes the DESeq2 package for differential expression analysis. By comparing gene expression levels between tumor and normal tissue samples, we identify genes that are significantly dysregulated in breast cancer, providing valuable insights into the molecular drivers of the disease.

4️⃣ In addition, by performing exploratory data analysis among breast cancer patients, we uncover potential subgroups and patterns within the dataset. The application of PCA enables us to visualize the multidimensional nature of the transcriptomic data and cluster breast cancer patients based on similarities in gene expression profiles.

## Key Features:

👉 Utilization of the TCGAbiolinks package for querying breast cancer transcriptome datasets from TCGA.

👉 Querying, cleaning, and preprocessing of the transcriptomic data to ensure high-quality results.

👉 Differential expression analysis using DESeq2 to identify genes dysregulated in breast cancer.

👉 Visualization of differentially expressed genes between tumor and normal tissue samples.

👉 Exploratory data analysis to uncover subgroups and patterns within the breast cancer patient cohort.

👉 Application of PCA for patient clustering based on gene expression profiles.
